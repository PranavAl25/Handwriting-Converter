                            <p>
                                Dysgraphia is a learning disability that affects a person's ability to write coherently and legibly. It impacts nearly 20%, or 1 in 5, of individuals around the world. Individuals with dysgraphia can struggle with self-esteem and experience social anxiety.

                            <p>
                                Individuals with dysgraphia often seek therapy to improve their writing skills and cope with the challenges they face. Therapy may involve various approaches such as occupational therapy, handwriting exercises, and cognitive-behavioral techniques. However these treatments are very expensive, hence needing a solution that can let individuals live with dysgraphia lifelong.

                                The Dysgraphia Web App provides an innovative solution to individuals with dysgraphia.

                                Users can upload images of their handwriting for both uppercase and lowercase letters. Special character images, such as punctuation marks, are also uploaded. This collection of images forms the basis for creating personalized handwriting.

                                The uploaded images are processed to create a library of characters. Each character image is associated with its corresponding letter or special character. This library is used to generate the personalized handwriting.

                                The app takes the user's uploaded text content and places each character's handwritten image onto a lined paper background. The result is a downloadable image that resembles handwritten notes on lined paper.
